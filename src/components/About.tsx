      <h3>About Me</h3>

      <p>
        I’m a full‑stack software engineer who enjoys taking ideas from rough concept
        to reliable, shipped software. My work lives at the intersection of clean backend
        architecture and modern, pragmatic frontends.
      </p>

      <p>
        I build with React, TypeScript, Django REST Framework, and Swift — with an emphasis
        on readable code, well‑designed interfaces, and systems that feel thoughtful to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recent projects include a Django + React portfolio dashboard, a multi‑folder
        Python/TypeScript app (RealSync), an iOS notes app in SwiftUI, and a Chrome extension
        for time calculations.
      </p>
